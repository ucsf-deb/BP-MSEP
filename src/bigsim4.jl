Conduct an enormous grid of simulations.
This is *not* a regular part of the MSEP package; it is a user of that package.

The mission:
For logistic model.  Calculate MSEP for various values of abs(z)>tau (values below) for all the predictors (BP, SQ [lam= 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5], AB [lam=1.4, 1.6, 1.8], CT [lam=1.5, 1.75, 2]).   Do simulation for sigma=0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, and 1.25 and plot ratio of MSEP for z_BP divided by MSEP for each of the weighted predictors versus sigma and for each cutoff separately (tau=0, 1.28, 1.5, 1.645, 2, 2.33, and 2.5).  Repeat for cluster sizes of 5, 7, 20, and 100.   Repeat for mu=-1 and -2.   Perhaps just create an overall database with columns for MSEP for each predictor (so 11 columns plus columns to keep track of other parameters) and different rows for values of sigma, tau, cluster size and mu.  

So, we vary the following:
    1. predictor
    2. λ  for predictor in most causes
    3. Cutoff τ for MSEP
    4. σ
    5. cluster size
    6. μ

Chronologically, these fall into 3 groups:
    Data Generation: σ, μ, cluster size
    Prediction: predictor, λ
    Assessment: τ

Note the absence of covariates, which potentially could reduce this to the separable problem of
    1. compute predictor | Y for each possible y
    2a. compute distribution of z|Y.  Or even, for MSEP, just compute 
        ``p(z>\tau | Y)= p(Y|z)p(z)/p(Y)``.
    2b. Since computing  ``p(Y)`` is hard, just get z|Y numerically.

Also, we are only doing symmetric cases: no AS predictor, and no use of asymmetric measures of MSEP.

We need a way to loop over all possible generators.  The generators have slightly different parameters, since BP has no λ.  Then again, BP can be obtained from one of the other generators via zsimp, assuming the generator is not a cutoff generator.

There are 2 strategies.  The first is to focus only on the generator type and λ.  Return a function which takes the other values as arguments, and produces an evaluator.  The second is to take all the parameters as inputs and directly produce the evaluators.

This is not as simple as in Python because Julia [tends to use iterators rather than generators](https://itnext.io/generators-and-iterators-in-julia-and-python-6c9ace18fa93), and doesn't naturally do resumable coroutines.  The documentation describes `Tasks` as "coroutines" or ["one-shot continuations"](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/asynchronous-programming/), but if you `wait` for one to return a value it will not return again, as one-shot implies.More simply, it lacks a `yield` operator *that returns a value*.  There are at least 2 packages that provide macros allowing one to use this style, [ResumableFunctions](https://github.com/BenLauwens/ResumableFunctions.jl) and [FGenerators](https://github.com/JuliaFolds/FGenerators.jl).  The former is only shown with a single `@yield` statement in the function body, and it is unclear to me if it is designed to handle more than 1.  It is also apparently [unmaintained](https://github.com/BenLauwens/ResumableFunctions.jl/issues/56#issuecomment-1401431437).  In contrast, `FGenerators` example has multiple `@yield` statements.  However, the result doesn't seem to be a simple iterator since the documentation says you need `FLoops` to iterate over the result.

It seems safest to stick with the facilities of the base language, which imply either using iterators or using `Channels` to communicate with `Tasks`.  Since direct iteration would require tracking multiple levels to get a location (type of evaluator at the top level, λ below it, possibly other parameters as well), it seems best to rely on `Channel`.  `ResumableFunctions` explicitly avoid `Channel` because of performance, but these are relatively high level loops that are not performance critical for me.

There is a constructor for `Channel` that uses a function taking only a `Channel` instance as an argument, and the result is itself iterable.  So something fairly clean should be possible.
=#
function stupid(c::Channel)
    for i in 1:3
        put!(c, i)
    end
    put!(c, "all done")
end
for x in Channel(stupid)
    println(x)
end
